a. Package Managers
What is a Package Manager?

A package manager is a tool that helps developers install, update, remove, and manage libraries (packages) used in a project.

👉 Example:
Instead of writing all authentication or database code from scratch, we install ready-made packages.

Why do we need package managers in backend development?

Package managers help to:

Save development time

Reuse existing, tested code

Manage project dependencies easily

Maintain consistent versions across environments

👉 Example:
Using express for server creation instead of writing HTTP logic manually.

Problems faced if package managers are not used

Without package managers:

Developers must manually download libraries

Version conflicts occur

Hard to reproduce the same project on another system

No dependency tracking

Difficult collaboration in teams


b. NPM (Node Package Manager)
What is NPM?

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js.
It allows developers to install and manage JavaScript packages.

👉 Example command:

npm install express

Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?

NPM is important because it:

Provides access to millions of open-source packages

Automatically manages dependencies

Helps in running scripts

Ensures consistency across environments

How NPM helps in managing dependencies

Stores dependency information in package.json

Locks exact versions in package-lock.json

Automatically installs required sub-dependencies

👉 Example:

"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}


c. Backend Project Initialization
What is the command used to initialize a backend (Node.js) project?
npm init

Explain npm init

Asks questions (project name, version, description, etc.)

Creates a package.json file

Allows customization of project metadata

Explain npm init -y

Skips all questions

Automatically creates package.json with default values

Faster project setup

👉 Used when quick initialization is needed


d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization
1. package.json

Heart of the Node.js project

Stores:

Project metadata

Dependencies

Scripts

Required to run and manage the project

👉 Example:

{
  "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

2. node_modules

Contains all installed packages

Auto-generated by NPM

Very large in size


3. package-lock.json

Stores exact dependency versions

Ensures same versions across all systems

Prevents “works on my machine” issues
